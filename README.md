ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the **Natural Language Dialogue Group** at the **University of Southern California**.

ðŸ’¬ My research interests lie in **large language models (LLMs)** and **dialogue systems**, with a focus on personalization and reasoning.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on **personalized dialogue generation**. Here are a couple of projects I've built:
- ðŸ¤– [a2i2_chatbot](https://github.com/tzhang62/a2i2_chatbot): An interactive chatbot you can try out.
- ðŸ§  [Personalized_RAG](https://github.com/tzhang62/Personalized_RAG): Integrating external knowledge into persona-limited dialogue generation.

ðŸŒ± These days, I'm diving into **Graph RAG** and exploring **reasoning in foundation models**.

ðŸŽ¯ Outside of research, I love **skiing**, **surfing**, and practicing **Taekwondo** â€” keeps me balanced and energized!
